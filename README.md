# demo-go

This is a CLI client for the [demo-server](https://github.com/lbeckman314/demo) project.

## Wait, but why?

demo-web is a web-based client for demo-server. I wanted to see if I could write a simple CLI that could do the same thing (and wanted to try programming in Go!). Perhaps one would like to try out some of the programs offered by demo-server, but don't want to install a display server/manager and browser just to do that (or maybe they're installing those things but don't want to wait. Looking at you Gentoo!). As such you can run it in a TTY:

So if you're a minimalist or temrinal-aficionado, this is the demo package for you!
